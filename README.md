# Chat with friends. Don't get tempted by the facebook feed

Many of us use facebook this way:

1. Be in touch with people in tiny chat boxes at the bottom.

2. Get sucked into the feed. It's placed right in the middle and is bottomless for a reason.

This extension sends you to the **full-page messages** instead of the default page. Simple as that. It has no effect once you're already on the site.

But this will save hours of your life.
